## Installation

> Requires [PHP 8.1+](https://php.net/releases) and Laravel 8.x or 9.x

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require felixdorn/onboard
```

Publish the `ResumeOnboarding` middleware to your `app/Http/Middleware` directory:

```bash
php artisan onboard:middleware
```

> **If you're using Inertia**, you need to return false when `$request->inertia()` is true in the skip method of the
> middleware.

```php
    public function skip(Request $request): bool
    {
        if ($request->inertia()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return parent::skip($request);
    }
```

Add it to your `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
    // ...

    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            // ...
            \App\Http\Middleware\ResumeOnboarding::class
        ]   
    ]
```

Then, make sure that your `User` model uses `HasOnboarding`.

```php
use Felix\Onboard\Concerns\HasOnboarding;

class User extends Authenticatable {
    use HasOnboarding;
    
    // ...
}
```

You're all set.

## Usage

Add your onboarding steps in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

> If you have a lot of steps, you may consider creating an `OnboardServiceProvider` (don't forget to register it
> in `config/app.php`).

```php
use \App\Models\User;
use \Felix\Onboard\Facades\Onboard;

Onboard::add('verify_email')
    ->completedIf(function (User $user) {
        return $user->hasVerifiedEmail(); // or whatever    
    })
    ->skipIf(function () {
        return $user->github_id != null;
    })
    ->route('verification.notice')
    ->allowRoutes(['verification.verify']);

class HomeController extends Controller {
    public function index(\Illuminate\Http\Request $request) {
        return [
            'steps' => $request->user()->onboarding()->toArray()
        ];
    }
}
```

**WARNING**: Be careful, closure are memoized (their result are cached) for the duration of a request. This should never
be an issue in traditional apps, if you encounter problems, please let us know.

> You may call completedIf and skipIf many times, the step will be marked as completed or skipped if all the closures
> return true.

You may pass a closure to resolve a route lazily:

```php
Onboard::add('create_team')
    ->route(fn () => route('teams.create'));
```

## Globally allowed routes

Regardless of the state of the onboarding process, you may want the user to have access to certain urls, such as a
logout page.

```php
Onboard::allow(['/api/*']);

Onboard::allowRoutes(['logout', 'settings.billing']);
```

`Step::allow` and `Onboard::allow` make use
of [`honda/url-pattern-matcher`](https://github.com/laravel-honda/url-pattern-matcher), check it out for more details
about how to use pattern matching with Onboard.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
